# Discord.JS V12 İnfrastructure!

If you need a bot infrastructure, you can do all the work with it.


### Files you need to edit :

> config.js
- [Discord Geliştirici Portalı](https://discordapp.com/developers/application) you enter the token of the bot you have created into the string in front of the token part.

- In the Developers section, enter your own discord user id. If there are more than one developer, extend it by placing commas.

Example: ["1.id","2.id","3.id"]

> events/ready.js
<br>
- You can change the situation here.

### Permlevels

- Permlevels are automatic, whichever authority you write.
- BOT_OWNER only bot developer permission
